YE\n\n# ABSTRACT\n\nWe give a summary on the recent development of chaos theory in topological dynamics, focusing on Li-Yorke chaos, Devaney chaos, distributional chaos, positive topological entropy, weakly mixing sets and so on, and their relationships.\n\n# 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nTopological dynamics is a branch of the theory of dynamical systems in which qualitative, asymptotic properties of dynamical systems are studied, where a dynamical system is a phase (or state) space X endowed with an evolution map T from X to itself. In this survey, we require that the phase space X is a compact metric space and the evolution map T : X &rarr; X is continuous.\n\nThe mathematical term chaos was first introduced by Li and Yorke in 1975 [69], where the authors established a simple criterion on the existence of chaos for interval maps, known as \u201cperiod three implies chaos\u201d. Since then, the study of chaos theory has played a big role in dynamical systems, even in nonlinear science.\n\nIn common usage, \u201cchaos\u201d means \u201ca state of disorder\u201d. However, in chaos theory, the term is defined more precisely. Various alternative, but closely related definitions of chaos have been proposed after Li-Yorke chaos.\n\nAlthough there is still no definitive, universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos (in our opinion it is also impossible), most definitions of chaos are based on one of the following aspects:\n\n1. complex trajectory behavior of points, such as Li-Yorke chaos and distributional chaos;\n2. sensitivity dependence on initial conditions, such as Devaney chaos, Auslander-Yorke chaos and Li-Yorke sensitivity;\n3. fast growth of different orbits of length n, such as having positive topological entropy, or its variants;\n4. strong recurrence property, such as weakly mixing property and weakly mixing sets.\n\nSince there are so many papers dealing with the chaos theory in topological dynamics, we are not able to give a survey on all of them. We only can select those which we are familiar with, and are closely related to our interest, knowledge and ability. As we said before it is impossible to give a universe definition of chaos which covers all the features of the complex behaviors of a dynamical system, it is thus important to know the relationships among the various definitions of chaos. So we will focus on Li-Yorke chaos, Devaney chaos, distributional chaos, positive topological entropy, weakly mixing sets, sensitivity and so on, and their relationships in this survey.

LI AND X. YE\n\nNow we outline the development of chaos theory for general topological dynamical systems brie\ufb02y. The notions of topological entropy and weak mixing were introduced by Adler et al [1] in 1965 and Furstenberg [25] in 1967 respectively. After the mathematical term of chaos by Li-Yorke appearing in 1975, Devaney [19] de\ufb01ned a kind of chaos, known as Devaney chaos today, in 1989 based on the notion of sensitivity introduced by Guckenheimer [35]. The implication among them has attracted a lot of attention. In 1991 Iwanik [50] showed that weak mixing implies Li-Yorke chaos. A breakthrough concerning the relationships among positive entropy, Li-Yorke chaos and Devaney chaos came in 2002. In that year, it was shown by Huang and Ye [46] that Devaney chaos implies Li-Yorke one by proving that a non-periodic transitive system with a periodic point is Li-Yorke chaotic; Blanchard, Glasner, Kolyada and Maass [15] proved that positive entropy also implies Li-Yorke chaos (we remark that the authors obtained this result using ergodic method, and for a combinatorial proof see [53]). Moreover, the result also holds for so\ufb01c group actions by Kerr and Li [54, Corollary 8.4].\n\nIn 1991, Xiong and Yang [109] showed that in a weakly mixing system there are considerably many points in the domain whose orbits display highly erratic time dependence. It is known that a dynamical system with positive entropy may not contain any weakly mixing subsystem. Capturing a common feature of positive entropy and weak mixing, Blanchard and Huang [17] in 2008 de\ufb01ned the notion of weakly mixing set and showed that positive entropy implies the existence of weakly mixing sets which also implies Li-Yorke chaos. A further discussion along the line will be appeared in a forthcoming paper by Huang, Li, Ye and Zhou [41].\n\nDistributional chaos was introduced in 1994 by Schweizer and Sm\u00b4dotlessital [92], and there are at least three versions of distributional chaos in the literature (DC1, DC2 and DC3). It is known that positive entropy does not imply DC1 chaos [86] and Sm\u00b4dotlessital conjectured that positive entropy implies DC2 chaos. Observing that DC2 chaos is equivalent to so called mean Li-Yorke chaos, recently Downarowicz [21] proved that positive entropy indeed implies DC2 chaos. An alternative proof can be found in [40] by Huang, Li and Ye. We remark that both proofs use ergodic theory heavily and there is no combinatorial proof at this moment.\n\nThis survey will be organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide basic de\ufb01nitions in topological dynamics. Li-Yorke chaos, sensitivity and chaos in transitive systems will be discussed in Sections 3-5. In Section 6 we review the results on distributional chaos. In the following two sections we focus on weakly mixing sets and chaos in the induced spaces.\n\n# 2. PRELIMINARIES\n\nIn this section, we provide some basic notations, de\ufb01nitions and results which will be used later in this survey.\n\nDenote by N (Z+, Z, respectively) the set of all positive integers (non-negative integers, integers, respectively). The cardinality of a set A is usually denoted by |A|.\n\nLet X be a compact metric space. A subset A of X is called a perfect set if it is a closed set with no isolated points; a Cantor set if it is homeomorphic to the standard middle third Cantor set; a Mycielski set if it is a union of countably many Cantor sets. For convenience we restate here a version of Mycielski\u2019s theorem ([79, Theorem 1]) which we shall use.\n\n# Theorem 2.1 (Mycielski Theorem)\n\nLet X be a perfect compact metric space.

Topological dynamics\n\nBy a (topological) dynamical system, we mean a pair (X, T), where X is a compact metric space and T : X &rarr; X is a continuous map. The metric on X is usually denoted by d. One can think of X as a state space for some system, and T as the evolution law of some discrete autonomous dynamics on X: if x is a point in X, denoting the current state of a system, then T x can be interpreted as the state of the same system after one unit of time has elapsed. For every non-negative integer n, we can define the iterates Tn : X &rarr; X as T0 = id the identity map on X and Tn+1 = Tn &bull; T. One of the main topics of study in dynamical systems is the asymptotic behaviour of Tn as n &rarr; \u221e.\n\nNote that we always assume that the state space X is not empty. If the state space X contains only one point, then we say that the dynamical system on X is trivial, because in this case the unique map on X is the identity map.\n\nFor any n &ge; 2, the n-th fold product of (X, T) is denoted by (Xn, T(n)), where Xn = X \u00d7 X \u00d7 &hellip; \u00d7 X (n-times) and T(n) = T \u00d7 T \u00d7 &hellip; \u00d7 T (n-times). We set the diagonal of Xn as \u0394n = { (x, x, &hellip;, x) \u2208 Xn : x \u2208 X }, and set \u0394(n) = { (x1, x2, &hellip;, xn) \u2208 Xn : there exist 1 &le; i < j &le; n such that xi = xj }.\n\nThe orbit of a point x in X is the set Orb(x, T) = { x, T x, T2 x, &hellip; }; the \u03c9-limit set of x, denoted by \u03c9(x, T), is the limit set of the orbit of x, that is\n\n\u03c9(x, T) = \u2229 { Ti x : i &ge; n }n=1\u221e.\n\nA point x \u2208 X is called recurrent if there exists an increasing sequence { pi } in \u2115 such that limi &rarr; \u221e Tpi x = x. Clearly, x is recurrent if and only if x \u2208 \u03c9(x, T).\n\nIf Y is a non-empty closed invariant (i.e. T Y \u2286 Y) subset of X, then (Y, T) is also a dynamical system, we call it as a subsystem of (X, T). A dynamical system (X, T) is called minimal if it contains no proper subsystems. A subset A of X is minimal if (A, T) forms a minimal subsystem of (X, T). It is easy to see that a non-empty closed invariant set A \u2282 X is minimal if and only if the orbit of every point of A is dense in A. A point x \u2208 X is called minimal or almost periodic if it belongs to a minimal set.\n\nA dynamical system (X, T) is called transitive if for every two non-empty open subsets U and V of X there is a positive integer n such that Tn U \u2229 V \u2260 \u2205; totally transitive if (X, Tn) is transitive for all n \u2208 \u2115; weakly mixing if the product system (X \u00d7 X, T \u00d7 T) is transitive; strongly mixing if for every two non-empty open subsets U and V of X there is N > 0 such that Tn U \u2229 V \u2260 \u2205 for all n &ge; N. Any point with dense orbit is called a transitive point. In a transitive system the set of all transitive points is a dense G\u03b4 subset of X and we denote it by Trans(X, T). For more details related to transitivity see [57].\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system. A pair (x, y) of points in X is called asymptotic if limn &rarr; \u221e d(Tn x, Tn y) = 0; proximal if lim inf d(Tn x, Tn y) = 0; distal if lim inf d(Tn x, Tn y) > 0.

Furstenberg family\n\nThe idea of using families of subsets of Z+ when dealing with dynamical properties of maps was first used by Gottschalk and Hedlund [34], and then further developed by Furstenberg [26]. For a systematic study and recent results, see [2, 43, 47, 59, 93, 108]. Here we recall some basic facts related to Furstenberg families.\n\nA Furstenberg family (or just family) F is a collection of subsets of Z+ which is upwards hereditary, that is, if F1 \u2208 F and F1 \u2282 F2 then F2 \u2208 F. A family F is proper if N \u2208 F and N \u2209 F. If F1 and F2 are families, then we define\n\nF1 \u2229 F2 = {F1 \u2229 F2 : F1 \u2208 F1, F2 \u2208 F2}\n\nIf F is a family, the dual family of F, denoted by \u03baF, is the family\n\n{F \u2282 N : F \u2229 F' \u2260 \u2205, F' \u2208 F}\n\nWe denote by Finf the family of infinite subsets of N. The dual family of Finf is just the collection of co-finite subsets of Z+, denoted by Fcf. A family F is called full if it is proper and F \u2229 \u03baF \u2282 Finf.\n\nFor a sequence {pi}i=1\u221e in N, define the finite sums of {pi}i=1\u221e as\n\nFS{pi}i=1\u221e = \u2211i \u2208 \u03b1 pi : \u03b1 is a non-empty finite subset of N.\n\nA subset F of Z+ is called an IP-set if there exists a sequence {pi}i=1\u221e in N such that FS{pi}i=1\u221e \u2282 F. We denote by Fip the family of all IP-sets.\n\nA subset F of Z+ is called thick if it contains arbitrarily long runs of positive integers, i.e., for every n \u2208 N there exists some a \u2208 Z+ such that {a, a + 1, ..., a + n} \u2282 F; syndetic if it has bounded gaps, i.e., there is N \u2208 N such that [n, n + N] \u2229 F \u2260 \u2205 for every n \u2208 Z+. The families of all thick sets and syndetic sets are denoted by Ft and Fs, respectively. It is easy to see that \u03baFs = Ft.\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system. For x \u2208 X and a non-empty subset U of X, we define the entering time set of x into U as\n\nN(x, U) = {n \u2208 Z+ : Tnx \u2208 U}\n\nIf U is a neighborhood of x, then we usually call N(x, U) the return time set of x into U. Clearly, a point x is recurrent if and only if for every open neighborhood U of x, the return time set N(x, U) is infinite. In general, we can define recurrence with respect to a Furstenberg family.\n\n# Definition 2.2.\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system and F be a Furstenberg family.

In 2007, Kerr and Li [53] gave a new proof of Theorem 3.6 by using combinatorial method.

It was first proved by Huang and Ye using the notion of interpolating sets [49], and we state it here using the notion of independence by Kerr and Li [53]. Recall for a dynamical system (X, T), a tuple (x1, . . . , xk) \u2208 Xk is an entropy tuple if xi \u2260 xj for i \u2260 j and for any disjoint closed neighborhoods Vi of x, the open cover {V1c, . . . , Vkc} has positive entropy. When k = 2 we call it an entropy pair. A subset A of X is an entropy set if any tuple of points in A with pairwise different coordinates is an entropy tuple.\n\n# Theorem 3.8 ([49, 53]).\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system. Then a tuple on X is an entropy tuple if and only if it is a non-diagonal IE-tuple. In particular, the system (X, T) has zero topological entropy if and only if every IE-pair is diagonal (i.e. all of its entries are equal).\n\nBy developing some deep combinatorial tools Kerr and Li showed\n\n# Theorem 3.9 ([53]).\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system.

As far as we know the first to formulate the sensitivity was Guckenheimer, [35], in his study on maps of the interval (he required the condition to hold for a set of positive Lebesgue measure).

Let (X, T) be a dynamical system. For a pair of points x, y in X and a positive integer n, we define a function \u03a6xy on the real line by\n\n\u03a6xy(t) = n n 1#braceleftbig0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 : d(Tix, Tiy) < tbracerightbig,i\n\nwhere #(periodcentered) denotes the number of elements of a set. Clearly, the function \u03a6xy is non-decreasing, has minimal value 0 (since \u03a6xy(t) = 0 for all t \u2264 0), has maximum value 1/n (since \u03a6xy(t) = 1 for all t greater than the diameter of X), and is left continuous. Then \u03a6xy is a distribution function whose value at t may be interpreted as the probability that the distance between the initial segment of length n of the trajectories of x and y is less than t.\n\nWe are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the function \u03a6xy as n gets large. To this end, we consider the functions \u03a6xy and \u03a6xy defined by\n\n\u03a6xy(t) = lim sup \u03a6xy(t)n and \u03a6xy(t) = lim inf \u03a6xy(t)n\n\nThen \u03a6xy and \u03a6xy are distribution functions with \u03a6xy(t) \u2264 \u03a6xy(t) for all t. It follows that \u03a6xy is an asymptotic measure of how close x and y can come together, while \u03a6xy is an asymptotic measure of their maximum separation. We shall refer to \u03a6xy as the upper distribution, and to \u03a6xy as the lower distribution of x and y.\n\n# Definition 6.1\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system.

The dynamical system (X, T) is called distributionally chaotic of type i (DCi for short) if there exists an uncountable distributionally scrambled set of type i.\n\nIt should be noticed that in [98] and [10] DCi chaos only requires the existence of one distributionally scrambled pair of type i. It is not hard to see that any distributionally scrambled pair of type 1 or 2 is topological conjugacy invariant [98]. But a distributionally scrambled pair of type 3 may not be topological conjugacy invariant [10]. It is also not hard to construct a dynamical system that has a distributionally scrambled pair of type 2, but no distributionally scrambled pairs of type 1. A really interesting example constructed in [101] shows that there exists a minimal subshift which is distributionally chaotic of type 2, while it does not contain any distributionally scrambled pair of type 1.\n\n# 6.3. The relation between distributional chaos and positive topological entropy\n\nIt is known that in general there is no implication relation between DC1 and positive topological entropy (see [70] and [86]). In [97] Sm\u00eddotlessital conjectured that positive topological entropy does imply DC2. Oprocha showed that this conjecture is true for uniformly positive entropy minimal systems [81]. Finally, Downarowicz solved this problem by proving this conjecture in the general case [21].\n\n# Theorem 6.8 ([21])\n\nIf a dynamical system (X, T) has positive topological entropy, then there exists a Cantor distributional \u03b4-scrambled set of type 2 for some \u03b4 > 0.\n\nIt was observed in [21] that a pair (x, y) is DC2-scrambled if and only if it is mean scrambled in the Li-Yorke sense, that is\n\n1\n\nlim infN\u2192\u221e (1/N) \u2211k=1N d(Tkx, Tky) = 0", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3335, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71c3c0f7-6a0c-436a-ba72-21bee251c0db": {"__data__": {"id_": "71c3c0f7-6a0c-436a-ba72-21bee251c0db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e347ce2d-af15-4fa3-942b-d6cccb26d7c2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f7116a3864a257d3857b2c2e97f4b8554e9662b4080bed8be20a9eed7950a063", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF CHAOS THEORY IN TOPOLOGICAL DYNAMICS\n\nand\n\nlim sup\nNarrowright\u221e Nk=\n1 \u22111dparenleftbigT kx, T ky) > 0.\n\nRecently, Huang, Li and Ye showed that positive topological entropy implies a multivariant version of mean Li-Yorke chaos.\n\n# Theorem 6.9 ([40]).\n\nIf a dynamical system (X, T) has positive topological entropy, then there exists a Mycielski multivariant mean Li-Yorke (\u03b4n)-scrambled subset K of X, that is for every n greaterequal 2 and every n pairwise distinct points x1, . . . , xn element K, we have\n\n1 \u22111lessequali< jlessequaln dparenleftbigT kx, T kx) = 0\nN\nlim infNarrowright\u221e Nk=1 max i j\n\nlim supNarrowright\u221e Nk=\n1 \u221111lessequali< jminlessequaln dparenleftbigT kxi, T kx j) >\u03b4n > 0.\n\nWe remark that the key tool in the proof of Theorem 6.9 is the excellent partition constructed in [16, Lemma 4], which is different from the one used in [21].

Chaos via Furstenberg families.\n\nIn Section 2, we have shown that there is a powerful connection between topological dynamics and Furstenberg families. In 2007, Xiong, Ldieresisu and Tan introduced the notion of chaos via Furstenberg families. It turned out that the Li-Yorke chaos and some version of distributional chaos can be described as chaos in Furstenberg families sense.\n\n# Definition 6.11 ([108, 101]).\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system. Let F1 and F2 be two Furstenberg families. A pair (x, y) element X \u00d7 X is called (F1, F2)-scrambled if it satisfies\n\n1. for any t > 0, braceleftn element Z+ : d(T nx, T ny) < tbraceright element F1, and\n2. there exists some \u03b4 > 0 such that braceleftn element Z+ : d(T nx, T ny) >\u03b4 braceright element F2.\n\nA subset C of X is called (F1, F2)-scrambled if any two distinct points in C form a (F1, F2)-scrambled pair.

In particular, the dynamical system (X, T) is (M(1), M(1))-\u03b4-chaotic for some \u03b4 > 0.\n\nThere are two important Furstenberg families: the collections of all syndetic sets and all sets with Banach density one. They are so specific that we use terminologies: syndetically scrambled sets and Banach scrambled sets, when studying chaos via those two Furstenberg families.\n\nRecall that a subset F of Z+ is syndetic if there is N element N such that [n, n + N] \u2229 F \u2260 \u2205 for every n element Z+. Let (X, T) be a dynamical system. A pair of points (x, y) element X\u00b2 is called syndetically proximal if for every \u03b5 > 0 the set {n element Z+ : d(T^n x, T^n y) < \u03b5} is syndetic. If (X, T) is proximal, that is every pair in X\u00b2 is proximal, then every pair in X\u00b2 is also syndetically proximal [77]. Moothathu studied the syndetically proximal relation, and identified certain sufficient conditions for the syndetically proximal cell of each point to be small [77]. A subset S of X is called syndetically scrambled if for any two distinct points x, y element S, (x, y) is syndetically proximal but not asymptotic. In [78] Moothathu and Oprocha systematically studied the syndetically proximal relation and the possible existence of syndetically scrambled sets for many kinds of dynamical systems, including various classes of transitive subshifts, interval maps, and topologically Anosov maps.\n\nA subset F of Z+ is said to have Banach density one if for every \u03bb < 1 there exists N \u2265 1 such that #(F \u2229 I) \u2265 \u03bb #(I) for every subinterval I of Z+ where #(I) denotes the number of elements of I.

CHAOS IN THE INDUCED SPACES\n\nA dynamical system (X, T) induces two natural systems, one is (K(X), TK) on the hyperspace K(X) consisting of all closed non-empty subsets of X with the Hausdorff metric, and the other one is (M(X), TM) on the probability space M(X) consisting of all Borel probability measures with the weak*-topology. Bauer and Sigmund [13] first gave a systematic investigation on the connection of dynamical properties among (X, T), (K(X), TK) and (M(X), TM). It was proved that (X, T) is weakly mixing (resp. mildly mixing, strongly mixing) if and only if (K(X), TK) (resp. (M(X), TM)) has the same property. This leads to a natural question:\n\n# Problem 6\n\nIf one of the dynamical systems (X, T), (K(X), TK) and (M(X), TM) is chaotic in some sense, how about the other two systems?\n\nThis question attracted a lot of attention, see, e.g., [87, 12, 36] and references therein, and many partial answers were obtained. We first show that when the induced system is weakly mixing.\n\n# Theorem 8.1 ([13, 12])\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system. Then (X, T) is weakly mixing if and only if (K(X), TK) is weakly mixing if and only if (K(X), TK) is transitive.\n\n# Theorem 8.2 ([13, 66])\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system. Then (X, T) is weakly mixing if and only if (M(X), TM) is weakly mixing if and only if (M(X), TM) is transitive.\n\nIn [30], Glasner and Weiss studied the topological entropy of (K(X), TK) and (M(X), TM). They proved that\n\n# Theorem 8.3\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system.\n\n1. The topological entropy of (X, T) is zero if and only if the one of (M(X), TM) is also zero, and the topological entropy of (X, T) is positive if and only if the one of (M(X), TM) is infinite.\n2. If the topological entropy of (X, T) is positive, then the topological entropy of (K(X), TK) is infinite, while there exists a minimal system (X, T) of zero topological entropy and (K(X), TK) with positive topological entropy.\n\nTo show that when the dynamical system on the hyperspace is Devaney chaotic, we need to introduce some concepts firstly. We say that a dynamical system (X, T) has dense small periodic sets [48] if for any non-empty open subset U of X there exists a non-empty closed subset Y of U and k element N such that TkY \u2282 Y. Clearly, if a dynamical system has a dense set of periodic points, then it also has dense small periodic sets. The dynamical system (X, T) is called an HY-system if it is totally transitive and has dense small periodic sets. Note that there exists an HY-system without periodic points (see [48, Example 3.7]). Recently, Li showed in [60] that (K(X), TK) is Devaney chaotic is equivalent to the origin system (X, T) is an HY-system.\n\n# Theorem 8.4 ([60])\n\nLet (X, T) be a dynamical system with X being infinite.

There is a non-trivial minimal weakly mixing almost-HY-system (see [66, Theorem 4.11]), which is not an HY-system, since every minimal HY-system is trivial.\n\nRecall that a dynamical system (X, T) is proximal if any pair (x, y) \u2208 X2 is proximal.

Note that if (X, T) is strongly proximal, then it is proximal, since (X, T) can be regarded as a subsystem of the proximal system (M(X), TM).
