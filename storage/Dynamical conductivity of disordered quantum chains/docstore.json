Matter Physics, University of Geneva, Geneva 1211, Switzerland\n\n(Dated: November 15, 2022)\n\nWe study the transport properties of a one dimensional quantum system with disorder. We numerically compute the frequency dependence of the conductivity of a fermionic chain with nearest neighbor interaction and a random chemical potential by using the Chebyshev matrix product state (CheMPS) method. As a benchmark, we investigate the noninteracting case first. Comparison with exact diagonalization and analytical solutions demonstrates that the results of CheMPS are reliable over a wide range of frequencies. We then calculate the dynamical conductivity spectra of the interacting system for various values of the interaction and disorder strengths. In the high frequency regime, the conductivity decays as a power law, with an interaction dependent exponent. This behavior is qualitatively consistent with the bosonized field theory predictions, although the numerical evaluation of the exponent shows deviations from the analytically expected values. We also compute the characteristic pinning frequency at which a peak in the conductivity appears. We confirm that it is directly related to the inverse of the localization length, even in the interacting case. We demonstrate that the localization length follows a power law of the disorder strength with an exponent dependent on the interaction, and find good quantitative agreement with the field theory predictions. In the low frequency regime, we find a behavior consistent with the one of the noninteracting system \u03c92(ln \u03c9)2 independently of the interaction. We discuss the consequences of our finding for experiments in cold atomic gases.\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nDisorder has profound effects on quantum systems, as directly evidenced in the celebrated Anderson localization[1]. As shown by Anderson, disorder can change the plane waves of free particles to exponentially localized states with spectacular consequences for transport. Anderson localization is relevant for a host of systems ranging from condensed matter to classical waves. In particular, cold atomic gases, due to their remarkable controllability, have been instrumental in evidencing the localization of the wavefunction through seminal experiments of the groups of A. Aspect with laser speckles[2, 3] and M. Inguscio with quasi-periodic potentials[4, 5]. After sixty years since its proposal, Anderson localization still continues to present new challenges and mathematical developments[6].\n\nThe combination of disorder and interactions poses an additional layer of challenge especially in the context of condensed matter physics. This complicated problem in thermalized systems was tackled by perturbative[7], or renormalization group (RG) techniques in one dimension[8] and two dimensions[9\u201311]. While the disorder basically decelerates particles, which leads to a reinforcement of interactions, it can also weaken them due to the exponentially small overlap between two localized states. This competition is highly non-trivial and constitutes an intensively studied topic, which we call the problems of localization of interacting particles. Another direction related with this problem is to study the thermalization and ergodicity in isolated quantum systems with disorder and interactions, which is known under the name of many-body localization[12\u201315].\n\nOur target in this paper is one-dimensional systems, where strong quantum fluctuations lead to special states such as the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) characterized by correlations decaying in power law[16], and the effects of interactions are particularly strong. Furthermore, the disorder effects are also at their maximum, and even an infinitesimal disorder localizes all states for noninteracting particles. Thus one expects a severe competition between disorder and interactions. Renormalization group (RG) analysis shows the existence of a localized-delocalized transition both for fermions and bosons[8]. The localized phase for bosons, the Bose glass, persists in higher dimensions[17], and cold atomic systems again provides a controlled experimental access, confirming the Bose glass phase in biperiodic systems[18, 19].\n\nTo characterize disordered systems, transport is an important property. RG can access DC conductivity down to the temperature related to the inverse localization scale[8]. Below this scale, more phenomenological calculations predict the Mott variable range hopping behavior in the thermalized case of localization of interacting particles[20, 21] and zero DC conductivity in the isolated case of many-body localization[22]. AC transport also reflects the competition between disorder and interactions. Dynamical conductivity is exactly known for Anderson localization[23\u201325]. At high frequency, the behavior for the interacting particles can be extracted from the RG[8], and the low frequency behavior has been investigated by approximate methods such as a variational approach[26].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5188, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b6f6ff4-dcaf-4946-9b55-2f461bde4710": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b6f6ff4-dcaf-4946-9b55-2f461bde4710", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5a2f4afc-1c83-4217-9fd9-20cdb7ed568e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c834be96c81910a2f499bbdbc2c7a3c1cdc9915e9cbd6c3b1b1b2b6f08c8d762", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ecfcd93-d138-457c-a82c-5324d8dbfb8a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e92068acaa0cb06d8bbf64871aee3bd02f8e93a10e6d605289758ff8117a579", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The localized phase for bosons, the Bose glass, persists in higher dimensions[17], and cold atomic systems again provides a controlled experimental access, confirming the Bose glass phase in biperiodic systems[18, 19].\n\nTo characterize disordered systems, transport is an important property.

This situation is regrettable since cold atoms would be perfect systems to investigate such AC behavior of the conductivity with methods such as phase shaking of the optical lattice[27\u201329]. Indeed in biperiodic lattices, signatures of the localization such as a localization peak in the amplitude shaking of the optical lattice have been predicted[30] and observed[19].\n\nIn the present paper, we study the dynamical conductivity, i.e., the AC transport property as a function of frequency, in simple spinless fermion chains with nearest neighbor interactions in a random chemical potential.

MODEL AND PHYSICAL QUANTITIES\n\nLet us consider a spinless fermion system with a nearest-\nneighbor interaction\n\nH\u02c6 = J N\u22121 [ 1(\u02c6l a\u2211 2 a\u2020\u02c6l+1 + H.c.) + \u2206(\u02c6l \u2212 2)(\u02c6l+1 \u2212 2n1)]\n\nwhere N is the number of sites, \u02c6l aa\u2020(\u02c6l) is the fermion creation\n(annihilation) operator at the site l, and \u02c6l \u2261 \u02c6l an a\u2020\u02c6l is the num-\nber operator. The random chemical potential hl on each site\ndistributes uniformly in the finite interval hl \u2208 [\u2212W, W]. Thus\nW represents the strength of disorder. In view of the numerical\nsolution of this model we assume open boundary conditions,\nwhile the analytic solutions are usually performed with pe-\nriodic boundary conditions. Without disorder, this system is\nparticle-hole symmetric and half-filled. In this case, the sys-\ntem is known to be described at low energy by a TLL Hamilto-\nnian (see Appendix A). Since this model is solvable by Bethe\nansatz, the TLL parameters can be exactly computed. For ex-\nample, the parameter K controlling the decay of correlation\nfunctions is given by\n\nK = [2(1 \u2212 arccos(\u2206)/\u03c0)]\u22121.\n\nFor \u2206 = 0, the Hamiltonian represents free fermions with a random\nchemical potential. It is known that in one dimension, such a system\nis always exponentially localized for W > 0. The situation becomes\ncomplicated in the interacting case \u2206 , 0, but an analysis using field\ntheory and bosonization is possible. Such an analysis, using a RG\nprocedure shows the existence of a quantum phase transition between\na localized and delocalized phases. The system is localized when K\nis smaller than 3/2 even for an infinitesimal W. The dependency of K\non \u2206 is shown in Fig. 1 and it can be seen that K < 3/2 corresponds\nto \u2206 > \u22121/2.\n\nBesides the phase diagram itself the main physical quantity we will\nbe computing in this paper is the frequency dependence of the\nconductivity. All calculations will be done at zero temperature. We\nuse the Kubo formula relating the conductivity to current-current\ncorrelations. The current operator is\n\nj\u02c6l = 2 iJ(\u02c6l aa\u2020\u02c6l+1 \u2212 \u02c6l+1 ala\u2020 \u02c6).\n\nand the current-current retarded correlation function is written", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3525, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e622e730-2ba4-4fe9-b811-3427f26edc49": {"__data__": {"id_": "e622e730-2ba4-4fe9-b811-3427f26edc49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99554233-b8dd-4d76-a9a5-2f1933e60f8c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91854c49a1eba0705cc5d96dbe0159257c912184f8f269bca4166d4a06bf4387", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# III. METHODS\n\nWe explain the numerical method that we use to treat the interacting systems with disorder. In Sec. IV, we discuss the dynamical conductivity of such systems by comparing the results from this numerical method with those from a field theory for the low energy limit of this model. The details of the field theory are described in Appendix A.\n\nTo tackle the problem of low-dimensional interacting quantum systems, numerical methods utilizing matrix product states, such as DMRG, are very effective. The dynamical quantities such as conductivity and Green\u2019s function can be computed by performing a real-time evolution with e.g., time-evolving block decimation, after obtaining the ground state by DMRG, and such techniques have been widely used.\n\nThe spectral functions are calculable through the Fourier transformation of the temporal correlation functions. However, in the real-time evolution of matrix product states, the entanglement of the systems grows exponentially and the achievable time interval is limited. The acquired frequency resolution in this way was not sufficient for our purpose. Therefore, we used a numerical method which calculates the spectral functions directly in the frequency space.\n\nIn particular, to perform our calculation of the conductivity, we focus on the method CheMPS. This is a combination of DMRG and the kernel polynomial method, a method to evaluate the spectral function.\n\nThe dynamical conductivity is calculated from the current-current correlation function as given by Eq. (7). However, in the spectral representation, the real part of the conductivity is rewritten from Eq. (7) as:\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9) = \u03c9N\nwhere |\u03a80\u3009 (|\u03a8\u03bd\u3009) is the ground (\u03bd-th excited) state and E0 (E\u03bd) is its energy eigenvalue. We will use the expression for the numerical evaluation of the conductivity.\n\nUsing the Chebyshev polynomials:\n\nTn(\u03c9\u2032) = cos(n arccos \u03c9)\nwe can expand the spectral function as:\n\nA \u02c61 O\u02c62 (\u03c9) = 2(1 \u2212 s)\u03c0 \u221a1 \u2212 \u03c9\u20322[\u03bc0 + 2\u2211\u03bcnTn(\u03c9\u2032)]\nThe Chebyshev moments are represented as \u03bcn = \u3008\u03a80|\u02c61|tn\u3009, where |tn\u3009 = Tn(H\u2032) \u02c62 |\u03a80\u3009 are Chebyshev vectors.

RESULTS\n\nWe now examine the results obtained by the numerical method described in Sec. III. Before dealing with the interacting case, which is the focus of our study, let us first discuss the dynamical conductivity in the noninteracting case, which corresponds to Anderson localization, where both simpler numerical solutions and analytical approaches are available. Through the comparison of the results from CheMPS with from simpler methods, we can provide a benchmark for the reliability and applicability of CheMPS.\n\n# A. Noninteracting case\n\nLet us first revisit the noninteracting case \u2206 = 0. Without interactions, Eq. (1) is a tight binding system of free spinless fermions at half-filling.\n\nThe low energy region \u03c9/J 1, the 1/\u03c9 factor in the right hand side of Eq. (7) enhances the numerical error. Hence, to avoid this problem we employ the polarization-current correlation function instead of the current-current one. The polarization operator is defined as\n\nP = \u2211l=1N \u02c6nl\n\nand it is related to the current operator through the time derivative\n\n\u2202P/\u2202t = \u2212i\u2211l=1N[ \u02c6l, jtot ]\n\nThe polarization-current correlation function becomes\n\nCpc(t) = \u2212i\u03d1(t) \u3008[ \u02c6P(t), jtot(0)]\u3009\n\nand its time derivative is the current-current correlation function\n\n\u2202Cpc(t)/\u2202t = \u2212i\u03d1(t) \u3008[ \u2202P(t), jtot(0)]\u3009 = Ccc(t).\n\nPerforming the integral by part in Eq. (7), we obtain\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9) + i\u03c3\u2032(\u03c9) = \u03c9 \u222b\u2212\u221e\u221e dtei\u03c9t \u2202Cpc(t) = N \u222b\u2212\u221e\u221e dtei\u03c9tCpc(t).\n\nThus, the dynamical conductivity is represented as\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9) = N \u3008\u03a80| \u02c6\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 H + E0) \u02c6jtot|\u03a80</sub\u3009\n\nwhich can be evaluated by CheMPS with \u02c61 = \u02c6P and \u02c62 = \u02c6jtot in Eq. (9).\n\nThe expression for the dynamical conductivity is given as\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9) = \u03c30\u2211n=0\u221e Qn(Rn \u2212 Rn+1)\n\nwhere Qn and Rn are the solution of the recurrence equations\n\n2i\u03c9\u03c4Rn + n(Rn+1 + Rn\u22121 \u2212 2Rn) = 0\n\n2i\u03c9\u03c4(n + 1/2)Qn + (n + 1)2(Qn+1 \u2212 Qn) \u2212 n2(Qn \u2212 Qn\u22121) + Rn \u2212 Rn+1 = 0\n\nwith the boundary condition\n\nR0 = 1, i\u03c9\u03c4Q0 + Q1 \u2212 Q0 + R0 \u2212 R1 = 0\n\nIn practice, starting from the initial condition Qn = 0 and Rn = 0 for large enough n, we can obtain numerically Qn\u22121, . . . , Q0 and Rn\u22121, . . . , R0 from Eqs. (19) and (20), and finally normalize the sequence {Q0, . . . , Qn} and {R0, . . . , Rn} so as to satisfy the condition Eq. (21). Here, \u03c4i and \u03c30 are fitting parameters. Fig. 2 shows the dynamical conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9) calculated by the above procedure. In the high frequency region, the dynamical conductivity decays as a power law \u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9\u22122. In the low frequency region, the predicted analytical behavior is \u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c92(ln \u03c9)2 [20, 23, 38]. As can be seen from Fig. 2, such a behavior fits much better the data than \u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c92.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2598, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a690a96-8837-4073-a8f2-f86c576ce002": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a690a96-8837-4073-a8f2-f86c576ce002", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d43540c1-b004-4f4c-b6a0-539000df6522", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3164f45305e21bf9198bb7eb4ff18e001fcf4d9bf646e44f074adc98a426fdf3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# 5\n\n# B. Interacting case\n\nLet us now turn to the interacting disordered systems. In this case, since the dimension of the Hilbert space grows exponentially by increasing the system size, ED is not a viable method any more and we employ the CheMPS method described in the Sec. III as a numerical approach as well as the bosonization and variational replica approach as analytical methods to calculate the dynamical conductivity.\n\nTo benchmark the method, let us first compare the results of CheMPS for system size N = 250 with \u2206 = 0 and disorders W/J = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 with the ones obtained in the previous section with ED. The comparison is shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen from the comparison, the agreement is good over two decades of frequency, particularly in the regime \u03c9/J > 0.05. To check the finite size effect, we also compare the same CheMPS data with the ED result for N = 3200 (the same data as Fig. 3) in Fig. 4(b). While the agreement is good for large W, there is a deviation for small W. However, in the high energy region, the deviation is just a multiplication of a constant factor, and the power of the decay does not change. This confirms that our numerical approach properly captures the behavior of the dynamical conductivity in both low and high frequency regions at zero temperature. Hence CheMPS is a very useful technique for dealing with interacting systems, for which no other quantitative method is available.\n\nIn Fig. 5(a), we show the numerically calculated dynamical conductivity for the cases of \u2206 = 0, 0.2, and 0.4. We can see that the decay power of the high frequency region changes as we increase the interaction \u2206. To discuss the high frequency region and to compare the results with the bosonized field theory, a relatively small disorder strength is desirable, and we adopt W/J = 0.1 here. We fit the data in the high frequency region by a power law \u221d \u03c9\u207b\u03bc and plot \u03bc as a function of \u2206 in Fig. 5(c). We confirm that the variance of the data for dynamical conductivity shown in Fig. 5(a) is negligibly small by comparing the results for three bins of the various disorder configurations over which the average is taken. The variations of the data in Fig. 5(c) mainly arise from the power law fitting, and we estimate the error bars from the fittings in several frequency intervals on the high frequency regime.\n\nLet us compare the numerical results with the prediction from the field theory on the continuum model [8] (see Appendix).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2481, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75a0ad44-61dc-4bea-aa04-971560cf4c73": {"__data__": {"id_": "75a0ad44-61dc-4bea-aa04-971560cf4c73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06e0aba7-993a-432b-a014-8befc79c2344", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5569f65c55830158381cf896a3e32a656f04dd89c50f3e904cc1bac0314dc66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5a83ada-f763-470b-bee6-1db002e4c5e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba0275052baf0a389c85bf6f86536393cf62512f293a0de7ccae5b7ed45fb630", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# 6\n\npendix A). The behavior in the high frequency regime remains a power law while the exponent is indeed modified by introducing the interaction. Note that the precise analytical form is more complicated than a simple power law since the TLL parameter K is renormalized and depends on the scale. However, far from the transition point K = 3/2, the simple power law decay which neglects this renormalization becomes a good approximation [8, 16]. The modification of the exponent by the interaction reflects the renormalization of the scattering on the disorder and the power law behavior of the susceptibility of the charge-charge correlations in TLL. The analytical prediction for the exponent is \u03bc = 4 \u2212 2K [8, 16], which naturally reproduces the exponent \u03bc = 2 for the noninteracting case K = 1. The parameter K takes the value of K < 1 for repulsive interactions and K > 1 for attractive ones. As seen in Fig. 5(c), the numerically evaluated \u03bc has a similar global trend as the expectations from the field theory (dashed line), which is obtained by substituting the Bethe ansatz evaluation of K for TLL in the XXZ chain Eq. (2) into \u03bc = 4 \u2212 2K. In particular, in the region of \u22120.2 . \u2206 . 0.5, the numerically calculated \u03bc agrees quantitatively well with the analytical prediction. Figure 5(b) shows the plotting of (\u03c9/J)\u00b2\u03c3(\u03c9) for the same data as Fig. 5(a). The plotting of the data for \u2206 = 0 is almost horizontal, which indicates the decay follows \u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9\u207b\u00b2. We can see that the decay power \u03bc increases as \u2206 becomes larger.\n\nHowever, there exist surprising quantitative differences between the numerical results and the field theoretical predictions in the attractive regime (\u2206 . \u22120.2) and the strong repulsive regime (\u2206 & 0.5). The origin of these discrepancies is not clear at the present stage. On the repulsive side, a plateau-like structure appears in the regime \u2206 & 0.5 for the numerical results, which is incompatible with the exponent predicted by the continuum model. Several reasons are conceivable for this behavior. One possibility is the effect of irrelevant operators neglected in the field theoretical treatment. In particular, the scaling dimension of the irrelevant operator cos(4\u03c6) representing the umklapp processes on the lattice lowers as \u2206 is increased, and it finally becomes marginal in the \u2206 \u2192 1 limit. Another possibility is an error of the numerical extraction of \u03bc. As seen from Fig. 5(a), the localization frequency scale, i.e., the pinning frequency characterized by the peak of the dynamical conductivity, shifts to higher frequency as \u2206 is increased. Hence the region where the curve is fitted by the power law becomes narrower, and the estimation becomes less precise. On the attractive side, if we approach the localization-delocalization transition point K = 3/2 (\u2206 = \u22120.5), the renormalization flow is closer to the separatrix and the direction of the flow is not parallel to the disorder axis. Thus the effect of renormalization of the parameter K should become more important. To elucidate the reasons for this discrepancy between the numerics and the field theory is a very challenging problem and we leave it for a future study.\n\nLet us now turn to the disorder dependence of the pinning frequency and the conductivity at the peak for the interacting system. In Fig. 7(a), we show the dynamical conductivity calculated for the interaction \u2206 = 0.5 and various disorder strengths W/J = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8. Similarly than for the noninteracting case [see Fig. 3(a)], the pinning frequency \u03c9p increases and the peak height \u03c3(\u03c9p) decreases as the disorder strength W is increased. We plot \u03c9p and \u03c3(\u03c9p) as a function of W in Fig. 3(b). The pinning frequency and the peak height are well fitted as:\n\n\u03c9p \u221d W4/3\n\u03c3(\u03c9p) \u221d W\u22124/3\n# FIG. 5.\n\n(a) The dynamical conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9) for interactions \u2206 = 0, 0.2, and 0.4, and the disorder strength W/J = 0.1.

DISCUSSIONS AND SUMMARY\n\nNote that the data points of \u03c9p and \u03c3(\u03c9p) for W/J = 0.1 deviate from the fitting curves. We attribute it to the large finite size effect in the case of small W, as mentioned in the benchmark result [Fig. 4(b)].\n\nThis scaling is in good agreement with the analytical predictions that \u03c9p \u221d \u03be\u22121 and \u03c3(\u03c9p) \u221d \u03be [See Eq. (A16) in Appendix A]. Using the dependence of K on interactions Eq. (2), we obtain K = 3/4 for \u2206 = 0.5. This leads to \u03be \u221d W\u22124/3 by using the formula Eq. (A14) in excellent agreement with the numerical results. As can be seen both from the numerics and the above formula, repulsive interactions lead to a shorter localization length than for the noninteracting case.\n\nFinally let us discuss the behavior in the low frequency regime. In order to get a sizable range of the frequency interval below the pinning peak, and to prevent finite size effects from playing a major role, we take a relatively large value of disorder W/J = 0.8. The dynamical conductivity calculated for \u2206 = 0, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 is shown in Fig. 7(a). While there is a clear dependence of the exponent of the power law decay on the interaction \u2206 in the high frequency regime, the behavior remains similar on the low frequency side. One can see it more clearly in Fig. 7(b), where the curves have been rescaled by the value of the pinning frequency and conductivity at the peak.\n\nThe fitting curves by \u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c92(ln \u03c9)2 and \u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c92 are also shown, and the former fitting looks better than the latter. However, the present interval of data fitting below the peak is just one decade of frequency, and the acquisition of the data over a wider range is desirable for a more precise analysis.\n\nOn a qualitative side one would indeed expect to recover at low enough frequencies essentially the noninteracting behavior. Indeed frequencies lower than the pinning frequency correspond to probing scales large compared to the localization length. At that scales since the particles are exponentially localized, the effect of interactions should drastically decrease, leading back to the noninteracting behavior. On a more quantitative level, it is difficult to make an unambiguous comparison with existing analytical formulas, since the various calculations of the low frequency behavior suffer from their own limitations. The variational calculation [26] is unable to capture the logarithmic correction to the \u03c92 behavior. Calculations containing the logarithmic correction rely either.\n\nIn this paper, we have numerically computed the frequency dependence of the conductivity in one-dimensional spinless fermions with a nearest neighbor interaction and a random chemical potential. This problem is equivalent to XXZ spin chains in a random magnetic field along the z axis and to hard core bosons with nearest neighbor interactions and a random chemical potential. Using the CheMPS method, a variant of DMRG, adapted to the case we study, we have numerically calculated the dynamical conductivity over a broad range of frequencies, interactions, and disorder strength. We have benchmarked our method by comparisons with the non-interacting case. Since analytical approaches and numerical exact diagonalizations are applicable for the noninteracting systems, these results have been compared with those from CheMPS and we have confirmed that our method does capture the frequency dependence of the conductivity in a broad range of frequencies.\n\nWe have then investigated the dynamical conductivity of the interacting systems with CheMPS. In the high frequency regime, the conductivity follows a power law \u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9\u2212\u03bc. We have calculated \u03bc for various interaction \u2206, and found it agrees quantitatively with the expectation from the field theory \u03bc = 4 \u2212 2K and the K value from BA in \u22120.2 . \u2206 . 0.5. However there exist a deviation in the attractive and strongly repulsive regions. On the attractive side \u2206 . \u22120.2 (K &gt; 1.15), the estimated exponent \u03bc seems larger than expected from the TLL determination. On the repulsive side, a plateau-like structure appears in the region \u2206 &gt; 0.5 (0.5 \u2264 K &lt; 0.75).

On the attractive side \u2206 . \u22120.2 (K &gt; 1.15), the estimated exponent \u03bc seems larger than expected from the TLL determination. On the repulsive side, a plateau-like structure appears in the region \u2206 &gt; 0.5 (0.5 \u2264 K &lt; 0.75). We leave the clarification of the reasons for this deviation for future studies. We have also evaluated the localization length \u03be from the pinning frequency \u03c9p \u221d \u03be\u22121 as a function of the disorder strength, and found a reasonable agreement with the expected behavior of the localization length as determined by RG: \u03be \u221d (1/W2)1/(3\u22122K) and which is now dependent on both interactions and disorder. In the low frequency regime, we have performed numerical calculations for a large disorder W/J = 0.8. The scaling of dynamical conductivity is compatible with an \u03c92(ln \u03c9)2 behavior similar to the one of the noninteracting case but with a prefactor varying as (\u03be(\u2206)/\u03be(\u2206 = 0))3.\n\nThe low frequency behavior is difficult to access and although the numerics is indeed compatible with the \u03c92(ln \u03c9)2 behavior to ascertain the existence and power of the log correction.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3543, "end_char_idx": 4970, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cd1cbba-5535-4eb3-b855-22203171bdd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cd1cbba-5535-4eb3-b855-22203171bdd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b214e52d-3193-41a0-a7d9-5ae726bfbcc9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ecd9e13c2cb0bbbaf92e53b8974b645fc007e073094d00cf763e3091ce44499", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "07e73422-bc56-433a-8ca3-5b0b80d61632", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "46e26e2d23722ef2e8540aaf85bc72c71d685dcd72e49f088fa94a1e3b8c3817", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# 8\n\nrection data over a wider range of frequency is needed, an-\n\nanother challenge for future studies.\n\nIn addition to pushing the numerical investigations of the conductivity, it would of course be extremely interesting to test the results obtained in our study in cold atom experi-\n\nments. The existence of a peak as a response to shaking, sim-\n\nilar to the pinning peak in the conductivity discussed here, was indeed observed for bosons in a quasiperiodic potential and has been used as a key signature of the existence of the Bose glass in these systems. However, due to the large in-\n\nhomogeneities arising from the quadratic trapping potential, testing the power law behavior was not practically feasible. The existence of fermionic systems with disorder in quantum microscopes makes it possible to observe the features com-\n\nputed here more easily. In preforming a comparison with ex-\n\nperiments, we need to note the following points: i) the ex-\n\nperimental system size realizable for the moment are still rel-\n\natively small, typically of the order of 20 to 50 atoms per chain; ii) the temperature is still relatively high in fermionic systems. These conditions should not drastically affect the properties in the high frequency regime, roughly for \u03c9 > T, but of course will essentially change the low frequency behav-\n\nior of the dynamical conductivity. The low frequency regime is ultimately connected to the question of variable range hop-\n\nping and many-body localization. Addressing these issues via experiments and by the extension of numerical techniques to\n\nfinite temperature is clearly a considerable challenge.\n\n# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors appreciate fruitful discussions with Michele Filippone.

The most convenient way to deal with the inter-\n\nactions is to use the bosonization representation [16].\n\nThrough the Fourier transformation of the fermionic opera-\n\ntors (the lattice constant is set to unity):\n\na\u02c6k = 1/\u221aN \u2211 e^(-ikl) \u02c6l = 1/\u221aN \u2211 e^(ikl) \u02c6l a\u2020,\n\nthe disorder term in the Hamiltonian becomes\n\nH\u02c6dis = -\u2211hl(\u02c6l - 2) = -NN \u2211h(q)\u02c6k+q a\u2020 \u02c6k,\n\nFermionic systems Eq. (1) with a Fermi momentum kF = \u03c0/2 (half-filled band) corresponds to the nonmagnetized case in spin chains. For such systems special care should be ex-\n\nerted to treat the disorder and the situation is slightly more involved than starting from an incommensurate filling. As is well-known in one dimension, the system has low energy\n\nexcitations at momenta q ' 0 and q ' 2kF [16]. It is thus useful to separate the disorder into two slowly varying fields centered around these momenta, which are called forward and backward scattering respectively,\n\nh(x) = \u2211 eiqx h(q) for q'0\nhb(x) = \u2211 eiqx h(q + \u03c0) for q'0.\n\nNote that in the case of 2kF = \u03c0, the backward scattering leads to a real field hb(x).

This reflects the breaking of the particle-hole symmetry which is caused by one realization of the random chemical potential. Note that a system with perfect particle hole symmetry, such as a random bond system, would lead to a different fixed point, namely the random singlet phase [41].\n\nWe employ the usual representation of the fermion operators in terms of collective fields related to density and current, respectively [16], and connect them in the spin language [Eq. (4)] to the two angles needed to dictate the direction of the spin vector:\n\nSl+ ' (\u22121)l ei\u03b8(x) + ei\u03b8(x) cos(2\u03c6(x)),\n\nSl ' \u2212\u2207\u03c6(x)z + (\u22121)l cos(2\u03c6(x)),\n\n(A10)\n\nwhere x is the position of l-th spin, and the prefactors are omitted. Then the Hamiltonian is written as [8, 16]:\n\nH\u02c6 = 1 \u222b dx [uK(\u2207\u03b8(x))2 + K u(\u2207\u03c6(x))2]\n\n2\u03c0 \u222b\u2212 dx [\u03be(x)ei2\u03c6(x) + H.c]\n\n(A11)\n\nHere u is the velocity of excitations (u = vF for the noninteracting case) and K is the dimensionless parameter controlling the decay of correlations. We have neglected the irrelevant operator cos(4\u03c6(x)) which appears for the special case of nonmagnetized spin chains, or equivalently half-filled fermion chains. This operator is irrelevant for K > 1/2.\n\nIn this representation the current operator is the time derivative of the field \u03c6(x) [16] and thus the conductivity Eq. (7) is simply related to the Green\u2019s function of the field \u03c6(x) by:\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9) = \u2212 i2\u03c9 \u222b0\u221e dx dt \u3008[\u03c6(x, t), \u03c6(0, 0)]\u3009 ei\u03c9t\u2212t\n\n(A12)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is in units of e/h and \u03b5 = 0+ is a convergence factor.\n\nThe disorder term in Eq. (A11) can be eliminated for a Gaussian disorder by using the replica trick [8, 16]. This leads to an action of the form:\n\nS = 1 \u2211 \u222b dxd\u03c4 [1(\u2202\u03c4\u03c6\u03b1(x))2 + u(\u2202x\u03c6\u03b1(x))2]\n\n\u03c0K2 \u2212 Db \u2211 \u222b dxd\u03c41d\u03c42 cos[2\u03c6\u03b1(x, \u03c41) \u2212 2\u03c6\u03bd(x, \u03c42)]\n\n(A13)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03bd = 1, 2, . . . , n are the replica indices and the limit n \u2192 0 must be taken.\n\nThe disorder term is relevant for K < 3/2 even for an infinitesimal strength of the disorder Db. For K > 3/2 (\u2206 < \u22120.5), there is a separatrix, with a transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class between the localized and a delocalized TLL phase [8].\n\nThe localization length can be captured by an RG evaluation of this problem. Far from the transition point K = 3/2 the localization length behaves as [8]:\n\n\u03be \u221d ( 1 / Db )\u22123/2K\n\n(A14)\n\nIn addition to the RG method which can only give access to the physical quantities, either in the regime where the disorder is irrelevant or for scales smaller than the localization length, physical observables can be computed in the localized phase using a replica Gaussian variational approach [26]. This approximate approach leads to a low frequency behavior of the real part of the conductivity as:\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c92\u03be3\n\n(A15)\n\nwhere \u03be is the localization length. It does not include the logarithmic correction, which is known to occur for noninteracting particles \u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c92(ln \u03c9)2 [23, 25]. This is clearly an artifact of the variational approach and a logarithmic correction is also a priori expected for interacting systems as suggested by semiclassical calculations K \u2192 0 [39] and instanton expansions [21, 40].\n\nEquation (A15) implies that the pinning frequency \u03c9p and the corresponding value of the dynamical conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9p) scale as:\n\n\u03c9p \u221d \u03be\u22121, \u03c3(\u03c9p) \u221d \u03be.\n\n(A16)\n\nin agreement with the predictions from the RG calculations as well.
